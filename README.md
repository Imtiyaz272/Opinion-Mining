## YouTube Comments Analyzer
YouTube Comments Analyzer is an NLP-based tool designed to analyze YouTube comments and provide insightful metrics about user engagement, sentiment, and toxicity. The project leverages Deep Learning (DL) for sentiment analysis and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for emotion detection, ensuring accurate and meaningful insights.

####🔹 Features
✔ Sentiment Analysis – Classifies comments as positive, negative, or neutral using a deep learning model.
✔ Emotion Detection – Identifies emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, and surprise using SVM.
✔ Trending Topics – Extracts and visualizes most mentioned words and hashtags.
✔ Most mentioned hashtags

####🔹 Technologies Used
Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Deep Learning (DL) – TensorFlow/Keras (Sentiment Analysis)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Emotion Detection)

TF-IDF Vectorization

Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

####🔹 How It Works
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing – Cleans and tokenizes text, removes stopwords, and applies vectorization.
2️⃣ Feature Extraction – Extracts key terms and applies machine learning techniques.
3️⃣ Sentiment & Emotion Analysis – Uses DL and SVM models for classification.
4️⃣ Insights & Visualization – Generates reports on sentiment trends, keyword frequency, and toxicity levels.

🚀 Future Enhancements: Adding real-time YouTube API integration for dynamic analysis.
